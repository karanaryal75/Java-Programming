In this project, I have been asked to create 1D elementary CA, 2D Conway game of Life and Langtons loop.
1D Elementary CA:
In this project, I create grid when Itake input from user or from file. Then we implement the game rule, 
and create the next generation. I use rectangles to create board and fill them by color. This is mainly based
on single 1d arraylist. And the loop continues until the user ends.

2D Conway game of Life;
In this project, I create grid using two dimentional arraylist. I then compare the neighbour of each cell in
eight direction and return the value accordingly following the rule of this project. I take input from the user
or read from the line. Compute the board with the given logic.


Langtons Loop:
With the limited time, i couldnt complete this part of the project. So this is the only part not working
on my project.
