In this project I have been asked to create casion game, where I create blackjack, slotmachine and Roulette game.
Slot Machine:
In this project, I have been asked to create a game and determine the wining values with the payout rate. I have completely finished this
project with all the requirement given by the professor. Here i used the concept of arraylist, enum and with the help of array i was able to
complete this project without facing any problem. The game was simple with creating a combination with individual payout rates for each combination.

Roulette:
It is a game where the wheel is spun and lands on a certain number. the player has placed the bets and if the player matched the winning number then they
receive a certain payout money with different payout rates applied to different bets. In my projects I happen to complete all the bets that was assigned by our 
professor but i couldnt complete multiple bets. Meaning when the user wants to place multiple bets on different bet option , my program fails to do so. Therefore my
program only works for single bet and gives the payout rate for any bet that the user wants to input.

Blackjack:
It is a game played between dealer and player. where the value of dealer hand and player hand is determined and the closest to 21 card value wins. I successfuly happen
to make the blackjack game run but i fear there are certain bugs on my game code. like when the dealer gets an ace, my program happen to register the value of ace as
1 instead of 10 when the total card value of dealer is less than 16, like wise my code doesnot run when the player wants to play double down option as i didnt manage to 
have enough time to implement this method.
